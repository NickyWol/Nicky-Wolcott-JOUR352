    <h2>EXPERIENCE</h2>
    <h3>Sports editor</h3>
        <h4>The Diamondback</h4>
            <h5>April 2022 - present</h5>
                <p>I edit dozens of articles per month filed by 15 writers for content and clarity while also editing and fact-checking game stories three to four times per week on tight deadlines. I hire and mentor reporters with a focus on giving feedback to improve the writing and coverage of the sports desk. I schedule tweets daily to promote stories on the sports desk's Twitter account.</p>
    <h3>Men’s basketball beat reporter</h3>
        <h4>The Diamondback</h4>
            <h5>June 2022 - present</h5>
                <p>I file several articles per week, including features, game recaps, analysis pieces and breaking news stories. I scour press availabilities, independent sources and game analysis for topics of interest and collaborate with my beat partner to produce weekly content schedules and long-term ideas. I spoke with Jahari Long and his mother to write about his recovery from knee surgery and transfer to Maryland.</p>
    <h3>High school girls’ soccer beat reporter</h3>
        <h4>The Washington Post</h4>
            <h5>August 2023 - present</h5>
                <p>I cover high school girls’ soccer in Washington, D.C., and Maryland, mainly writing feature and game stories. I develop and identify reliable sources among coaches in the region to gather story ideas and information and conduct interviews before covering games to determine potential themes before writing context-driven game stories on strict deadlines.</p>
    <h3>Data reporter</h3>
        <h4>Capital News Service</h4>
            <h5>January 2023 - May 2023</h5>
                <p>I pitched stories grounded in reporting informed by data and featuring data visualizations. I wrote and reported on school start times in Maryland and demographics in the state’s General Assembly.</p>
    <h3>Editorial intern</h3>
        <h4>Herald-Mail Media</h4>
            <h5>June 2022 - August 2022</h5>
                <p>I wrote and reported on local news including breaking news, elections and economic disparity. I developed multiple enterprise and profile stories about local wealth inequality and sports.</p>
